# Video Web App

A local-first video management web application with an Express/SQLite backend and a React (Vite) frontend. Upload videos, generate thumbnails, trigger ffmpeg transcodes, and stream securely via JWT.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed and available on your `PATH`

## Getting Started
1. **Install backend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```
2. **Configure environment and initialize the database**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   npm run init-db
   ```
3. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```
4. **Run both apps together**
   ```bash
   cd ..
   npm run dev
   ```
5. **Other Essentials**
```bash
npm install
````
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

The root `npm run dev` script launches the Express API (port 4000 by default) and the Vite dev server (port 5173) concurrently. The backend serves uploaded videos and thumbnails from `server/src/public`.

## Running with Docker

Build and run backend + frontend locally:
```bash
docker-compose up --build

```

Access:

- Frontend → http://localhost

- Backend API → http://localhost:4000

## Deploying to AWS

1. Create ECR repos for video-webapp-backend and video-webapp-frontend.

2. Build, tag, and push images:
```bash
docker build -t video-webapp-backend ./server
docker tag video-webapp-backend:latest <acct-id>.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/video-webapp-backend:latest
docker push <acct-id>.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/video-webapp-backend:latest

docker build -t video-webapp-frontend ./client
docker tag video-webapp-frontend:latest <acct-id>.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/video-webapp-frontend:latest
docker push <acct-id>.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/video-webapp-frontend:latest
```

3. On EC2, pull and run:
```bash
docker pull <acct-id>.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/video-webapp-backend:latest
docker run -d -p 4000:4000 video-webapp-backend

docker pull <acct-id>.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/video-webapp-frontend:latest
docker run -d -p 80:80 video-webapp-frontend

```
Now app is live at `http://<ec2-public-ip>`.

### What To Do Next

1. Copy these files into your repo.  
2. Test locally with `docker-compose up`.  
3. Push both images to AWS ECR.  
4. Run them on EC2.

## Usage
- Register a user via `POST /api/auth/register` or the UI login form.
- Upload a video from the dashboard. The server probes metadata, stores the original file under `server/src/public/videos`, and generates a thumbnail in `server/src/public/thumbs`.
- Trigger a transcode to 720p (H.264/AAC) from the dashboard. Progress is reflected in the video status (`uploaded → transcoding → ready`).
- Stream or download originals/transcodes directly in the dashboard via the secure `/stream` endpoint.

## Troubleshooting
| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `ffmpeg` not found | Ensure ffmpeg is installed and accessible via your shell `PATH`. On macOS you can use Homebrew (`brew install ffmpeg`); on Linux use your package manager. |
| CORS errors in the browser console | Confirm `CLIENT_ORIGIN` inside `server/.env` matches the Vite dev URL (default `http://localhost:5173`). Restart the server after changes. |
| File upload limits | Multer defaults allow reasonably large files, but Node may still hit memory limits on extremely large uploads. Adjust `LIMIT_FILE_SIZE_MB` in `.env` and restart if needed. |
| Database missing tables | Re-run `npm run init-db` inside `/server` to create or migrate the SQLite schema. |

## File Storage Layout
```
server/src/public/
  videos/   # original and transcoded mp4 files
  thumbs/   # generated thumbnails (.jpg)
```

Backups are as simple as copying the SQLite file (`server/data.sqlite` by default) and the `public/` directory.

## Testing Users
Create accounts directly via the UI login form (switch to Register tab) or issue a `POST /api/auth/register` call with `{ "username": "demo", "password": "demo123" }`.

## Scripts Overview
- `npm run dev` (root): run both backend and frontend concurrently
- `npm run dev` (server): nodemon-powered Express server with auto-reload
- `npm run init-db` (server): create the SQLite tables
- `npm run lint` (server/client): run ESLint for code quality
- `npm run build` (client): build production-ready frontend assets

Enjoy building locally without any cloud dependencies!

## 

To change your web app to transcode videos into 1080p instead of 720p, you need to update the ffmpeg command in your backend code to use 1080p settings.

In your project, the relevant code is likely in server/src/videos/video.service.js. Look for where ffmpeg is called to transcode videos (it may use .size('1280x720') or similar for 720p).

Change the resolution to 1920x1080 for 1080p. For example:



The transcoding resolution is set by the ffmpeg option:

```bash

'-vf scale=1280:-2',

```

This means the video is scaled to 1280 pixels wide (720p). To transcode to 1080p, change this line to:

```bash

'-vf scale=1920:-2',

```

This will scale the video to 1920 pixels wide (1080p).
